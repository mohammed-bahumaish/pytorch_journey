# PyTorch Journey

Welcome to my PyTorch learning journey! This repository contains step-by-step hands-on PyTorch notebooks documenting my learning journey from PyTorch basics to more advanced neural network concepts.

## Learning Journey Structure

### ðŸ“š Current Tutorials

1. **Linear Regression** (`1-linear-regression/`)
   - Building your first neural network
   - Training loop implementation
   - Model saving and loading
   - Data visualization with matplotlib

2. **Neural Network Fundamentals** (`2-basic-dosage/`)
   - Gradient accumulation patterns
   - Understanding backpropagation mechanics

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammed-bahumaish/pytorch_journey
   cd pytorch_journey
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Open in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
   Then use the Jupyter extension in VS Code to run the notebooks directly in the editor.
